🎤 Introduction
Why StreamLocal?
Podcasts are growing, but they are scattered across multiple platforms, making it difficult for listeners to discover new content and for creators to reach their audience.

🚀 StreamLocal solves this! It brings together audio and video podcasts in one place, offering:
✔ Seamless navigation between audio and video content.
✔ Personalized discovery of new shows.
✔ A creator-friendly platform to share content.

💡 Inspiration
This project was inspired by the lack of a centralized hub where both audio and video podcasts can coexist with an intuitive and user-friendly design. Many platforms force creators to pick between formats, but we believe users should have the freedom to choose how they engage with content.

👀 What makes it different?
Unlike Spotify or YouTube, StreamLocal prioritizes an interactive experience for podcasts with smooth navigation, a clean UI, and a focus on both content consumers and creators.
